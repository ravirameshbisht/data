This query retrieves all employees who joined the company within the last six months. It compares each employee’s join_date with a calculated date that is exactly six months before today (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'). If the employee’s join_date is greater than or equal to that past date, meaning they joined recently, their record is included in the result.
