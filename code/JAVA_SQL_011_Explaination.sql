- The query checks each employee ID and looks for the next consecutive ID (id + 1).
- It uses NOT EXISTS to verify that the next ID is missing in the table.
- If the next ID does not exist, it is treated as a gap in the sequence.
- The missing value is calculated as id + 1 and returned as missing_id.
- Results are ordered to show missing IDs in ascending order.
